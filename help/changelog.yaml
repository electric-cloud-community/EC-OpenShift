  - Third-party libraries were updated to address security issues.
1.6.1:
  - Renaming from "CloudBees Flow" to "CloudBees CD".
1.6.0:
  - Provisioning of Binary Dependencies (for example Grape jars) in the agent resource, required by this plugin, is now delivered through a newly introduced mechanism called Plugin Dependency Management. Binary dependencies will now be seamlessly delivered to the agent resource from the Flow Server, any time a new version of a plugin is invoked the first time. Flow Repository set up is no longer required for this plugin.
1.5.4:
  - Renaming from "Electric Cloud" to "CloudBees"
1.5.3:
  - Configurations can be created by users with "@" sign in a name.
1.5.2:
  - Fixed plugin documentation.
1.5.1:
  - Updated the plugin icon.
1.5.0:
  - Improved plugin promotion time.
1.4.1:
  - |
    Fixed 'Import Microservices' procedure by the following:
     * fixed handling of default values for template parameters;
     * fixed parsing of image URL for cases of non default registry and repository namespace which contains dots;
     * fixed parsing of service port name which may be used by route as target port reference;
     * procedure now can succeed without optional parameters related to environment mapping provided.
  - Fixed 'Deploy Service' procedure by the following - deploy of route can now succeed without hostname provided.
  - Added 'Test Connection' step for 'EditConfiguration' procedure.
1.4.0:
  - Configured the plugin to allow the ElectricFlow UI to create configs inline of procedure form.
  - 'Added new procedures: Discovery, Import Microservices.'
1.3.2:
  - Fixed non-ascii characters in help file.
  - Added support for retrieving and creating the plugin configurations through the "Configurations" option on the application process step and the pipeline stage task editors.
  - Configured the 'setup' procedure step that retrieves groovy dependency jars to run all subsequent procedure steps on the same resource.
1.3.1:
    - __Requires EC-Kubernetes plugin version 1.0.5 or higher to be installed.__
    - Removed unused parameter __additionalAttributes__ from container mapping configuration.
    - When deploying a microservice through ElectricFlow on an OpenShift cluster, the plugin will now monitor the deployment progress in the cluster and cause the step to fail in case the deployment does not complete within the deployment timeout configured as part of the service mapping. The default timeout value is 120 seconds.
    - When deploying a microservice through ElectricFlow on an OpenShift cluster, the service name to use in OpenShift can now be overridden through the service mapping.
    - When deploying a microservice through ElectricFlow on an OpenShift cluster, the deployment name to use in the cluster can now be overridden through the service mapping. See section **Blue/Green Deployments** in the EC-Kubernetes plugin help for details on how this ability can be used to implement a blue/green deployment strategy.
    - Added support for canary deployments. See section **Canary Deployments** in the EC-Kubernetes plugin help for details.
1.3.0:
    - Renamed __Provision Cluster__ procedure to a more specific __Provision Cluster on ESX__. The parameters in the renamed procedure remain the same.
    - Updated the 'provisionCluster' operation used during service deployment to use the 'Check Cluster' procedure that checks that the OpenShift cluster exists and is available for service deployments.
    - Added procedure __Undeploy Service__ to undeploy a previously deployed service.
    - Added 'kubernetesVersion' parameter in the plugin configuration to allow the user to identify the Kubernetes version running on the Openshift cluster master. The parameter will default to '1.6' if no value is specified.
