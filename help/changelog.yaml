1.4.1:
  - Fixed 'Import Microservices' procedure by the following:<ul><li>fixed handling of default values for template parameters;</li><li>fixed parsing of image URL for cases of non default registry and repository namespace which contains dots;</li><li>fixed parsing of service port name which may be used by route as target port reference;</li><li>procedure now can succeed without optional parameters related to environment mapping provided.</li></ul>
  - Fixed 'Deploy Service' procedure by the following - deploy of route can now succeed without hostname provided.
  - Added 'Test Connection' step for 'EditConfiguration' procedure.
1.4.0:
  - Configured the plugin to allow the ElectricFlow UI to create configs inline of procedure form.
  - 'Added new procedures: Discovery, Import Microservices.'
1.3.2:
  - Fixed non-ascii characters in help file.
  - Added support for retrieving and creating the plugin configurations through the "Configurations" option on the application process step and the pipeline stage task editors.
  - Configured the 'setup' procedure step that retrieves groovy dependency jars to run all subsequent procedure steps on the same resource.
1.3.1:
    - <i>Requires EC-Kubernetes plugin version 1.0.5 or higher to be installed.</i>
    - Removed unused parameter <i>additionalAttributes</i> from container mapping configuration.
    - When deploying a microservice through ElectricFlow on an OpenShift cluster, the plugin will now monitor the deployment progress in the cluster and cause the step to fail in case the deployment does not complete within the deployment timeout configured as part of the service mapping. The default timeout value is 120 seconds.
    - When deploying a microservice through ElectricFlow on an OpenShift cluster, the service name to use in OpenShift can now be overridden through the service mapping.
    - When deploying a microservice through ElectricFlow on an OpenShift cluster, the deployment name to use in the cluster can now be overridden through the service mapping. See section <b>Blue/Green Deployments</b> in the EC-Kubernetes plugin help for details on how this ability can be used to implement a blue/green deployment strategy.
    - Added support for canary deployments. See section <b>Canary Deployments</b> in the EC-Kubernetes plugin help for details.
1.3.0:
    - Renamed <i>Provision Cluster</i> procedure to a more specific <i>Provision Cluster on ESX</i>. The parameters in the renamed procedure remain the same.
    - Updated the 'provisionCluster' operation used during service deployment to use the 'Check Cluster' procedure that checks that the OpenShift cluster exists and is available for service deployments.
    - Added procedure <i>Undeploy Service</i> to undeploy a previously deployed service.
    - Added 'kubernetesVersion' parameter in the plugin configuration to allow the user to identify the Kubernetes version running on the Openshift cluster master. The parameter will default to '1.6' if no value is specified.
