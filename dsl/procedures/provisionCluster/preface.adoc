The procedure checks if the OpenShift cluster exists and is reachable with provided details. If not, then
provisions a new one.

The procedure uses ESX plugin's import procedure to setup underlying VMs.For system requirements, see

https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.0/install_config/install/prerequisites.html#install-config-install-prerequisites[here]

For networking requirements, see https://docs.openshift.org/latest/install_config/install/prerequisites.html#prereq-network-access[here]

Once VMs are available, the procedure uses https://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible[ansible scripts] provided by OpenShift to setup an OpenShift cluster.

* Ansible (v2.2.0.0) must be installed on CloudBees CD agent machines and *'ansible-playbook'* command should be included in PATH.
* *'htpasswd'* must be installed and included in PATH on CloudBees CD agent machine.
* CloudBees CD agent machine should have passwordless SSH access to imported VMs.
* The plugin passes the hostname to OVF template using OVF property " prop:hostname=some_hostname" while importing using OVF tool.
* The OVF template must have a mechanism (https://github.com/vmware/open-vm-tools[open-vm-tools] is one such example) to read this OVF property and set its hostname accordingly.
* It should also add "127.0.0.1 some_hostname some_hostname.domain_name" entry to /etc/hosts file.
* https://buildlogs.centos.org/centos/7/paas/x86_64/openshift-origin/origin-docker-excluder-1.4.0-2.el7.noarch.rpm[origin-docker-excluder] and https://buildlogs.centos.org/centos/7/paas/x86_64/openshift-origin/origin-excluder-1.4.0-2.el7.noarch.rpm[origin-excluder] RPMs must be already installed on OVF template.
